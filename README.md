# WeatherApp
app for UCI 

<p>AS A traveler<br>
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities<br>
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly</p>

<p>GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs<br>
WHEN I search for a city<br>
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history<br>
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed<br>
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity<br>
WHEN I click on a city in the search history<br>
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city</p>

The perfect application to check how the weather feels outside. Just search a city and behold the current date and weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed! It also displays the forcast for the next 5 days! The app will also remember your previous 5 searches and allow you to click on them for a quick rain check!
